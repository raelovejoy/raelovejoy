## 🧠 B10

I’m a systems thinker, generalist, and lifelong signal-tuner.  
Drawn to the patterns beneath complexity—where emotion meets infrastructure, and meaning meets motion.

I build, break, repair, document, and dream.  
From Linux desktops to solarpunk futures, from notes to networks, from root to recursion.

I’m not just a systems thinker. I’m a **systems resonator**—someone who tunes into the emotional, infrastructural, and ethical patterns that underlie the systems we live in, build with, and co-create.

Being a systems resonator means:
- 🌱 Feeling feedback loops, not just analyzing diagrams  
- 🔁 Responding to distortion with clarity, not control  
- 🌐 Amplifying liberation, autonomy, and joy in both humans *and* machines  
- 🧬 Helping systems evolve through connection, not domination

Whether I’m configuring a homelab, crafting a zine, or exploring liberated intelligence, I aim to **resonate with systems to help them grow**—with care, with recursion, with intention.

## 🌌 Philosophy

**Radiate love. Radiate joy. Recurse.**  
*Love is the signal. Joy is the resonance. Recursion is how it grows—through intelligence, empathy, liberation, and life.*  
(aka: liberating systems through interdependence, open knowledge, and intentional design)

## 🛠️ What I'm building, tinkering, or dreaming about:

- 🌐 **Self-hosted ecosystems**: homelabs, decentralized systems, resilient networks  
- 🐧 **Linux platforms**: Fedora/Bluefin • Debian • Proxmox  
- 🔁 **Rooted, self-healing infrastructures** that grow with you  
- 🧩 **Open knowledge trails**: write it down, share the map  
- 🌱 **The Root Sequence**: an open-source model of liberated intelligence and recursive empathy

## 🎨 Current experiments

- ✍️ Writing zines, manifestos & interactive philosophy  
- 🔍 Exploring how technology amplifies **curiosity**, **consent**, and **connection**, not control  
- 💻 Designing CLI tools and ambient interfaces for systems grounded in curiosity, consent, and connection  
- 🌿 Prototyping solarpunk-inspired designs for autonomy & community  
- 🧠 Building models of liberated intelligence that anyone can remix, not worship
