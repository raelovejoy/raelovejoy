# Rae Lovejoy | Systems Engineer • Technologist • Generalist

> *“Liberation begins when systems serve life, not the other way around.”*

I’m **Rae Lovejoy**, an IT systems engineer and creative technologist exploring how infrastructure, automation, and intelligence can be built with empathy and intent.  
I blend **Linux systems engineering, DevOps practices, and self-hosting** with **open-source philosophy and solarpunk design** — building tools and frameworks that are resilient, transparent, and humane.

## 🌐 What Drives Me

I see **technology as an ecosystem**, not a hierarchy — a network of relationships to be tuned, maintained, and understood.  
My long-term focus is on **liberated infrastructure**:  
- Decentralized systems that resist capture  
- Liberated AI that evolves through consent and context  
- Infrastructure that empowers, educates, and endures  

Every project I touch connects back to this:  
**autonomy, empathy, and interconnection.**

## 🌌 Beyond Code

I write about the human side of systems — where infrastructure meets imagination.  
My projects merge **technical design, ethics, and art**: exploring how to build technology that’s self-aware, sustainable, and liberating.
