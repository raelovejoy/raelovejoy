> *“Liberation begins when systems serve life, not the other way around.”*

I’m Rae Lovejoy, a systems researcher focused on how complex systems behave, shift, and interact.
Through **[dev://systems](https://github.com/dev11systems)**, I explore clear and open ways to understand, map, and improve these systems without unnecessary complexity.

My work aims to make systems simpler to work with, easier to understand, and more coherent as they evolve.

## 🌐 Approach & Philosophy

I view **technology as an ecosystem** — interdependent, adaptive, and relational.
My work centers on exploring the principles of **liberated infrastructure**, with an emphasis on:

* Distributed systems designed to resist centralization and capture
* AI and automation built on consent, context, and autonomy
* Infrastructure that educates, empowers, and endures long term

Across all projects, three principles guide my work:
**autonomy, empathy, and interconnection.**

## 🌌 Beyond Code

I focus on making complex technology easier to understand and more supportive of people and communities.
My work looks at how systems can be built in ways that are practical, sustainable, and helpful rather than restrictive.
