## 🧠 About Me

I'm a systems explorer, generalist, and lifelong tinkerer.  
Driven by curiosity, guided by intention, fascinated by the interconnectedness of all things.

I build, break, repair, document, and dream —  
from Linux desktops to decentralized homelabs, from ideas to working systems.

## 🌌 Philosophy

**Liberating systems, one connection at a time.**  

---

## 🛠️ What I'm Building, Tinkering, or Dreaming About:

- 🌐 **Self-hosted ecosystems** (homelab, containers, decentralized services)
- 🐧 **Linux systems**: Bluefin • Silverblue • Fedora • Proxmox
- 🔄 **Resilient, self-healing infrastructures**
- ✍️ **Documenting insights** to leave a trail for others (and myself)
- 🌱 **Open source** everything — because knowledge grows when it’s shared

---

## 🎨 Current Experiments

- ✨ Writing philosophy for the future of open systems
- 🛠️ Prototyping frameworks for decentralized, user-sovereign technology
- 🌿 Designing solarpunk-inspired systems that prioritize resilience, community, and sustainability
- 🧠 Developing systems thinking models that embed ethics and evolutionary growth
- 🔍 Investigating how technology can amplify curiosity and autonomy, not control
- 🚀 Optimizing open-source tools to empower creative sovereignty and self-hosted ecosystems
