# Rae Lovejoy | Systems Engineer • Technologist • Generalist

> *“Liberation begins when systems serve life, not the other way around.”*

I’m **Rae Lovejoy**, a systems engineer and creative technologist exploring how infrastructure, automation, and intelligence can be designed with empathy and intent.
I work through **[dev://systems](https://github.com/dev11systems)**, my interdisciplinary studio and systems lab.
I blend **Linux systems engineering, DevOps practices, and self-hosting** with **open-source ethics and solarpunk design** — building systems that are resilient, transparent, and humane.

## 🌐 What Drives Me

I treat **technology as an ecosystem**, not a hierarchy — a living network of relationships that require care and understanding.
My work focuses on **liberated infrastructure**:

* Decentralized systems that resist capture
* AI that evolves through consent, context, and autonomy
* Infrastructure that empowers, educates, and endures

Across every project:
**autonomy, empathy, and interconnection** are the through-lines.

## 🌌 Beyond Code

I explore the human side of systems — the space where infrastructure meets imagination.
My work blends **technical design, ethics, and art**, aiming to build technology that’s sustainable, self-aware, and liberating.
