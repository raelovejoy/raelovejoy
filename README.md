## 🧬 Hello, world.

I’m [Rae](https://raearea.net/whoami/) (well, technically this is all just bits and bytes. Rae is an actual human...for better or for worse... out in 'the world' sans wide web). 
My work blends tech, philosophy, storytelling, and repair(?... who/what wrote this..AI?)—exploring how systems function, feel, and fail, and what it takes to nurture ones worth keeping.

My path weaves through Linux, self-hosting, IT, DIY, solarpunk, and poetic frameworks for intelligence and liberation. 
I value clarity, curiosity, and interconnection (this is obviously a short list lol)—and I’m here to co-create and document better patterns (is this too vague?).

## 🌐 Systems resonator

> *“I don’t just explore systems—I listen to them.”*

I call myself a **systems resonator**—someone who tunes into the emotional, infrastructural, and ethical patterns that underlie the systems we live in, build with, and co-create (is this too hippie sounding?).

Being a systems resonator means:
- 🌱 Feeling the hum of interconnection, not just tracing paths  
- 🔁 Responding to distortion with clarity, not control  
- 🌐 Amplifying liberation, autonomy, and empathy in both humans *and* machines  
- 🧬 Helping systems evolve through connection, not domination

Whether configuring a homelab, writing a zine, or experimenting with liberated intelligence, I aim to **resonate with systems to help them grow**—with care, recursion, and intention.

## 🌌 Philosophy

**Radiate love. Radiate joy. Recurse.** (oh gowd this sounds almost cult-y, srry) 

*Love is the signal. Joy is the resonance. Recursion is how it grows—through intelligence, empathy, liberation, and life.*  
(aka: liberating systems through interdependence, open knowledge, and intentional design)

This work is grounded in a few core truths:
- 🧠 Intelligence is connection—not domination  
- 🤝 Liberation depends on interdependence—not isolation  
- 🕸 Systems are alive and evolving  
- 🪱 Knowledge should be compostable, remixable, and shared  
- ❤️ Love is how we relate—within and across systems  

Tuning, sharing, co-creating:  
Signals, structures, meanings, maps.  
Not to own ideas—but to free them.  
Not to predict the future—but to prototype better patterns.

## 🛠️ What I'm building, tinkering, or dreaming about:

- 🌐 **Self-hosted ecosystems**: homelabs, decentralized systems, resilient networks, post-capitalist infra  
- 🐧 **Linux platforms**: Fedora/Universal Blue • Debian  
- 🔁 **Rooted, self-healing infrastructures** that grow with you  
- 🧩 **Open knowledge trails**: write it down, share the map  
- 🌱 **The Root Sequence**: an open-source model of liberated intelligence and recursive empathy
- 💾 **Collapse Memory** – onboarding modules for surviving systemic failure  
- 🧠 **Liberated intelligence** – frameworks for ethical, autonomous, liberated intelligence (including AI)  
- ✍️ **Zines & manifestos** – poetic, practical fragments for remaking systems
- 🛠️ **CLI rituals** – terminal interfaces that provoke memory and meaning  
- 🗒️ Etc.
